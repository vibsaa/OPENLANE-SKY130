## [D]: how is the eulers path for more functionally complex circuits .??is it done manuallyy??
### [A]: As long as we have duality principle, euler's path works well. For other complex IP's 
which are multi-height and non-dual, ALIGN is one of the open-source tools which is trying 
to automatically convert circuit to layout, but manual intervention is still needed, and so 
its called custom layout.
